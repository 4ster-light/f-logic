## 📜 Overview

This project is meant as educational material in order to learn about basic
interpreters and the process of lexing and parsing a language as well as the
concept of AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), therefore why it supports only basic
logic symbols.

The choice of interpreting logic formulas was made due to its relative
simplicity and the fact that it is related to computer science.

This second tutorial (which you can find
[here](https://aster.deno.dev/posts/introduction-to-interpreters-part-2/)) is
written in F# in order to learn about the language and showcase why functional
programming is a good choice for this kind of project, due to its strong
algebraic data types and common patterns like recursion and pattern matching.
You can find the Python version (easier and more readable for beginners) of this
project [here](https://github.com/4ster-light/py-logic) with the corresponding
tutorial
[here](https://aster.deno.dev/posts/introduction-to-interpreters-part-1/).

## 🛠 Usage

- Run `dotnet run` to generate a truth table for the given formula:

```bash
$ dotnet run
Enter a logical formula (e.g., P & Q -> R, !A | B):

P & Q -> R

P | Q | R | P & Q -> R
----------+-----------
T | T | T | T
T | T | F | F
T | F | T | T
T | F | F | T
F | T | T | T
F | T | F | T
F | F | T | T
F | F | F | T
```

- Run `dotnet run -- --debug` to see the tokens and AST generated by the parser:

```bash
$ dotnet run -- --debug
Enter a logical formula (e.g., P & Q -> R, !A | B):

P & Q -> R

- Formula:
  - P & Q -> R
- Tokens:
  - Variable "P"
  - AndOp
  - Variable "Q"
  - ImpliesOp
  - Variable "R"
  - Eof
- Expression:
  - Implies (And (Var "P", Var "Q"), Var "R")
```
